Add logic to useLocalStorage hook to handle changing keys (no plan to use this but sounds nice).<br />
Restructure and generalize custom hooks for use in other projects.<br />


### Styling
Movie poster hover behavior.<br />
Poster button positioning and hover behavior<br />
Themes using React context.<br />
Improve layouts, themes, etc.

Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format.<br />
Simple documentation for custom hooks to increase reusability.<br />
